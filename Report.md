### Introduction

Introduce the real-time auction system project by providing background information and context. Mention the purpose of the system, its significance, and the goals you aim to achieve.

### Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem that your project addresses. Discuss the challenges in creating a real-time auction system and the need for such a system. Outline the objectives you set out to achieve.

### Methodology and Algorithms

#### Auction Management

Describe the data structure used to represent auctions, including item details such as name, starting price, bid deadline, and current highest bid. Explain the functions implemented for creating new auctions, updating auction status in real-time, managing the bidding process, closing auctions, and maintaining bid history.

Discuss the communication protocol established to facilitate message exchange between clients and the server, ensuring efficient handling of multiple concurrent clients.

#### User Interface

Explain the design of the user interface, covering views for browsing available auctions, placing bids on active items, initiating new auctions, monitoring bidding history, and viewing won items. Discuss how you prevent auction owners from bidding on their own items.

#### Real-Time Updates

Detail how real-time updates are provided to users, including live status changes, instant bid notifications, and real-time countdowns for ongoing auctions. Discuss the multi-threading approach used to handle a minimum of five simultaneously connected clients.

#### User Authentication

Describe the implementation of user registration and login capabilities. Explain how user credentials are securely stored in a server-based text file (database.txt), the use of authentication tokens, and the development of a robust user authentication system. Highlight how authentication measures are used for secure access to bidding history and transactions.

#### Error Handling

Discuss the robust error handling mechanisms in place, including checking return values, logging errors, and providing clear error messages for users. Address unexpected situations such as network errors or invalid user input.

#### General Requirements

Explain how system stability is maintained by avoiding the use of system() functions. Discuss the use of dynamic memory allocation, a Makefile for compilation, adherence to C code style guidelines, version-controlled Git repository, README file, appropriate comments, and code organization.

### Testing Procedures

Provide details on the testing procedures employed to validate the functionality and reliability of the real-time auction system. Include scenarios for both expected and error cases. 

### Conclusion

Summarize the key achievements of the project, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Discuss potential future improvements or enhancements.

### Appendices

Include any additional information, code snippets, or diagrams that support the content of the report.

### References

List any external resources, libraries, or references used during the project development.

### Acknowledgments

Thank any individuals or organizations that contributed to the project.

### Project Report Submission

Provide information on how the project report and associated materials will be submitted.
